      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p> This tale of love and values unfolds in the class-conscious England of the late 18th century. The five Bennet sisters - including strong-willed Elizabeth and young Lydia - have been raised by their mother with one purpose in life: finding a husband. When a wealthy bachelor takes up residence in a nearby mansion, the Bennets are abuzz. Amongst the man's sophisticated circle of friends, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. But when Elizabeth meets up with the handsome and - it would seem - snobbish Mr. Darcy, the battle of the sexes is joined.</p>

      <p>The protagonist Elizabeth Bennett is a witty, sarcastic, somewhat stubborn young lady who really has an opinion about quite a lot including why she would not marry simply because of it is expected of her. Mr. Guy Darcy is a shy, rich, man who defiantly believes there is such a thing as superior birth.</p>

      <h1>Why I Love This Book</h1>
      <p>Pride and Prejudice is the right balance of romance, drama and humour. Jane Austen showed that not all women in the early 1800's aspire and live only to marry for money and love. The stigmatism of Money Marries Money was wiped away in this once then, controvertial piece literature. Jane Austen created one of the first Female Heroin that does not need a man to validate their worth</p>
